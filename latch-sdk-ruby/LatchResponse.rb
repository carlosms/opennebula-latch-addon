# This class models a response from any of the endpoints in the Latch API.
# It consists of a "data" and an "error" elements. Although normally only one of them will be
# present, they are not mutually exclusive, since errors can be non fatal, and therefore a response
# could have valid information in the data field and at the same time inform of an error.
